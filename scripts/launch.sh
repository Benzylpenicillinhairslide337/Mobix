# Root-detection bypass lives in this chain, so apps that refuse to run on a
# rooted device MUST be started this way. Tapping the launcher icon starts
# them unhooked and they will show "Rooted device detected".
#
# Implementation note: this drives the frida CLI rather than the Python
# bindings. Since Frida 17 the `Java` global comes from frida-java-bridge, which
# the CLI injects and a raw create_script() does not - bindings give
# "ReferenceError: 'Java' is not defined". Piping from `tail -f /dev/null`
# gives the CLI a stdin that never reaches EOF, so its session stays alive
# without a TTY.
